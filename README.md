# Optimal Channel Network
This is a python code to generate Optimal Channel Networks (OCNs) from random initial network. This code uses Landlab functionalityies for stroring and processing rasters. The Optimization algorithm is greedy which changes the confirguration as long as it reduces the opbjective functional. The Rolling windwo function is from \href{http://www.latex-tutorial.com}{LaTeX-Tutorial}.
