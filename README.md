# Optimal Channel Network
This is a python code to generate Optimal Channel Networks (OCNs) from random initial network. This code uses Landlab (\href{https://github.com/landlab/landlab}) functionalityies for stroring and processing rasters. The Optimization algorithm is greedy which changes the confirguration as long as it reduces the opbjective functional. The Rolling windwo function is from \href{https://gist.github.com/seberg/3866040l}.
